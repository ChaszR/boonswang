Fixed the 1 Click Import demo content, clicking the import demo content added the content corrcetly but created a conflict with the theme options panel, that error is now fixed, also when the permalink was set to default and you set the services, blog or portfolio page the content was not displayed, again that error is fixed.

Info:
If you clicked the import demo content button in the theme options panel and you are having errors, please just delete the custom menus (Appearance -> Menus), delete those menus or the next time you import the content they will be duplicated.
